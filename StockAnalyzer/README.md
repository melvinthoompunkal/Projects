This project implemented the python library Yfinance to grab historical data of a stock, with this data I was able to strengthen my data analysis skills as well as data refinement to use only the data that I needed.

Using Google Sheets API I was able to move the data from my code into my SpreadSheet and from there I was able to use graphs to visualize the data and organize it properly. 

This Project helped increase my knowledge about stock indicators such as (RSI, SMA, EMA, BollingerBands, MACD, VWAP, stochastic_oscillator, calculate_OBV) while also helping my data refinement and data analysis skills through the process.

Some obstacles I came across was figuring out which data was necessary for creating graphs on Spreadsheets and how the valueInputOption='RAW' put the numbers as Strings which lead to a problem when trying to graph them.
I was able to resolve this by creating a secondary function that properly cleaned the data specifically for graphing (Graphing_RSI). 

I plan on adding onto this project by integrating AI analysis and adding other external factors such as news and other geopolitical volatility issues to indicate where the stock could move.
